Monolith	Contract wallet paired with a debit card	Monolith is an Ethereum-powered solution allowing you to spend your ETH and ERC-20 in real-life, the way you're used to: with a debit card accepted anywhere.  The cards are available and shipping to the UK, France, and most other European countries: all 31 countries of the EEA. The app to manage the card and the wallet is currently live on iOS, with an Android version coming soon.  The fees are kept to a minimum. There is no setup fee, no activation fee, nor point of sale fees. The only usage fee users have to cover is a 1-2% top-up fee depending on the token used.  Monolith's cards are paired with a non-custodial contract wallet to secure crypto assets to the best of current technical possibilities. Users can set up a whitelist as well as daily spending limits to protect their assets, even if their wallet was to be compromised, without compromising on the solution's usability.	https://monolith.xyz/		https://github.com/tokencard/	https://www.reddit.com/r/Monolith_Web3/	https://discord.gg/YrrFpFd	https://medium.com/@Monolith	https://twitter.com/monolith_web3	https://www.facebook.com/MonolithWeb3/			Monolith Studio	finance	visa, erc20, card, finance, wallet	GPL-3.0	Ethereum	live	2016-10-06	2019-08-12	0xaAAf91D9b90dF800Df4F55c205fd6989c977E73a, 0xe0731c1a30e6ed0c6e9162eb87fc85e831caf382, 0xab613544D53173E65e75a2390F7512F6fe941257, 0x23bed532f16f93d4dd0b051f71e3f64db5acf34d													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/982vq%2Fmonolith-logo-black-horizontal.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/44zra%2Fprofile-photo-resized.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/jf2qs%2Fmonolith-app-and-card-v3.jpg

Our vision is to make financial markets universally accessible.  Ambisafe’s founder, Andrii Zamovskiy, has been at the forefront of financial innovation since 2008 when he began to design alternative financial systems (prior to the launch of Bitcoin).  Andrii began to work on his first cryptocurrency. After launching several exchanges, multi-currency wallet, and merchant service Andrii has formed Ambisafe. Since formation in 2015 Ambisafe has provided the technological infrastructure for more than 50 tokens (https://explorer.ambisafe.co/#/assets) .

APPII	Verifying. Everyone. Everywhere.	Performing background checks on prospective employees is costly, takes time and involves wasted effort. Background checks can take up to 12 weeks in certain industries, costing, on average, £100, and checks are unnecessarily repeated even though previous employers have undertaken the same checks.  Employers and job seekers are unnecessarily put at disadvantage.  APPII assists job seekers pre-verify their identity, backgrounds and career history and also easily capture the participation in lifelong learning or lifelong learning.  Employers can request job candidates to perform background checks easily and quickly through the APPII mobile app.  Utilising blockchain technology ensures that any verification of career history is only undertaken once. Job seekers can reuse captured and verified information in subsequent background checks diminishing the time and effort for both them and employers.	https://www.appii.io	https://www.appii.io/	https://github.com/APPII-IO				https://twitter.com/appii_io	https://www.facebook.com/appii.io			APPII	identity	recruitment, career, management, employment, credentials	Private	Ethereum	live	2017-04-07	2017-05-21														https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/zw8ym%2Fappii-final-blue-jpeg.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/mqfmn%2Fappii-shadow-icon.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/b65n8%2Fgary-mckay-mobile-and-web-profile-large.png

EtherTweet	Microblogging with 160 characters	This is a decentralized microblogging service running on the Ethereum blockchain.  The service provides basic Twitter-like functionality to tweet messages of up to 160 characters.  Here, decentralization means there is no company or central authority in control of what is being published.  The system is censorship resistant in the sense that once a message is published, it can only be removed by the publisher.  All accounts can receive donations in Ethereum's Ether crypto currency. Being able to receive donations can be an incentive to run a decentralized microblogging feed.  To not expose the user's social graph to the world, following other accounts is not supported on purpose.			https://github.com/yep/eth-tweet								Jahn Bertsch	social	twitter, blogging, communication, social, media	GPL v3.0	Ethereum	prototype	2015-12-17	2017-05-28

Basil	Allowing users to change the light color of a Basil plant	This is a sample Dapp built on top of ZOS (ZeppelinOS). It presents a basic contract Basil.sol and then uses an AppManager from ZOS to upgrade the contract to BasilERC721.sol using a proxy that preserves the original contract's state, while mutating its logic. The upgraded contract also makes use of ZOS' on-chain standard library, connecting to a proxy of the MintableERC721Token implementation of the openzeppelin-zos release. As for functionality, the Dapp allows users to change the light color of a Basil plant, using an Arduino and an RGB wifi light bulb.

The Pyramid Game	Place blocks to build a pyramid together	The Pyramid Game was originally launched on the Ethereum network in 2017. Since then, thousands of blocks have been placed by hundreds of users.  Anyone can place a block in the pyramid. Blocks on the bottom layer cost 0.005 ETH. Blocks on every higher layer cost twice as much as the layer below. For example:  Layer 0: 0.005 ETH  Layer 1: 0.01 ETH  Layer 2: 0.02 ETH  Layer 3: 0.04 ETH  Layer 4: 0.08 ETH  etc..  If a block is placed on top of your block, you get half the value of that block (minus small fee of 0.5%).	https://pyramidgame.jesbus.com/	https://pyramidgame.jesbus.com/	https://github.com/JesseBusman/PyramidGame				https://twitter.com/_Pyramid_Game_				Jesse Busman	high-risk	pyramid, game, entertainment, metamask	Open Source	Ethereum	live	2017-09-30	2019-02-17	0xC3c94e2d9A33AB18D5578BD63DfdaA3e0EA74a49													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/gjdsd%2Fthe-pyramid-game-logo-400-200.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/vz32z%2Fthe-pyramid-game-logo-192-192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/2njhg%2Fscreenshot-83-1200-630.jpg

The original work is not stored on the blockchain but a cryptographic digest of it, allowing the copyright holder to keep its work in secret if desired. Second, Engraved also constitutes a system for file integrity verification, where file distributors can register files with their checksums under a custom namespace if desired.			https://github.com/engravedTech		https://engraved.slack.com/	https://medium.com/@engravedTech	https://twitter.com/engravedTech				engraved.tech	property	copyright, registry, integrity, files, ownership	GPLv3	Ethereum	abandoned	2017-10-16	2019-04-09

LocalEthereum	Peer-to-peer ETH-to-fiat marketplace	LocalEthereum strives to be the most secure and private marketplace that crypto has seen. It's one of the easiest and safest ways to swap ETH for fiat currency and vice versa.  Unlike other over-the-counter marketplaces, we’re the first to implement a completely in-browser cryptography setup to protect you off and on the blockchain.  The escrow account is a decentralized Ethereum smart contract. Rather than trusting a centralized authority to hold your ETH, LocalEthereum's escrow system is trust-free.  Every conversation is protected by strong end-to-end encryption to secure your privacy. We can only decrypt your messages if the key is volunteered; e.g. during a payment dispute.  Optionally, you can log in without a password by using a compatible Ethereum wallet. Most popular wallets including imToken, MetaMask and Ledger are compatible.	 https://localethereum.com/r/sotd	https://localethereum.com/r/sotd			https://t.me/localethereumdotcom	https://blog.localethereum.com/	https://twitter.com/localethereum	https://www.facebook.com/localethereumdotcom			LocalEthereum Pty Ltd	exchanges	trading, marketplace, fiat, exchange, metamask	N/A	Ethereum	live	2017-10-25	2019-02-14	0x867ffb5a3871b500f65bdfafe0136f9667deae06,  0x09678741bd50c3e74301f38fbd0136307099ae5d													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/2uf3d%2Flogo.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/8yegx%2Ficon.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/mbcyz%2Fscreen1.png	
DADA	Speak visually and create collaborative rare art.	DADA is the only social network where people from all over the world speak to each other through drawings, creating collaborative art.  Artists in different countries create spontaneous visual conversations, expressing themselves regardless of geography or language.  DADA is one of the pioneering projects to prove a use case for digital art and blockchain. With over 160K members, it is the biggest art community on the Ethereum blockchain and, with about 110K drawings made on its platform, it holds the biggest collection of artworks ready to be traded as Non-Fungible Tokens.  DADA is creating a new economic paradigm for artists in which art-making is decoupled from transactions, allowing artists to create, collaborate, and experiment freely while they receive a passive income for their contribution to the community.	https://dada.nyc/	https://dada.nyc/artgallery	https://github.com/powerdada/dada_sc		https://t.me/dadadotnyc	https://medium.com/@PowerDada	https://twitter.com/powerdada	https://www.facebook.com/dadasocial			Beatriz Ramos, Judy Mam, Abraham Milano, Juan González, Juan Florville	media	marketplace, art, community, digital, media, community	MIT	Ethereum	live	2017-10-25	2019-02-25	0x34d77a17038491a2a9eaa6e690b7c7cd39fc8392, 0xf6034a7430af04db58be94a0e12ac244af2ff55a	0x07b63d78c6068b45ef3fde0d258219810a36d255												https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/5mkdb%2Fcolorlogo.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/nv8q3%2Fsquare.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/4f8s6%2Fdescontrolmini.png

Real-estate investments can be easily liquidated at any time, without the need for a middleman, at our platform (peer-to-peer) or at any regulated exchange. Investors regularly receive dividends as their properties generate income, and the value of investments increase as properties appreciate. Sellers address a much larger audience of investors, while relying less on middlemen and intermediaries. All resulting in a simple, transparent transaction process with significantly reduced fees and overhead.   Starting in Switzerland, blockimmo is focused on facilitating an accessible, streamlined real-estate market, while delivering value to our users one step at a time. Showing that blockchain offers real world benefits, and helping existing entities like cadasters explore and adopt this technology.	http://blockimmo.ch	https://blockimmo.ch/	https://github.com/blockimmo-ch/	https://www.reddit.com/r/blockimmo	https://get.status.im/chat/public/blockimmo	medium.com/blockimmo	https://twitter.com/blockimmo	https://www.facebook.com/blockimmo			blockimmo AG	property	real-estate, marketplace, ownership, housing	NPOSL-3.0	Ethereum	live	2018-05-01	2018-12-03	0xe72ad2a335ae18e6c7cdb6daeb64b0330883cd56, 0xf31b25b753dfb6a79cf36630dcf03ff53178341c, 0x7223b032180cdb06be7a3d634b1e10032111f367, 0x2d1711ada9dd2bf8792ad29dd4e307d6527f2ad5, 0x117a00B7763961D54a1b96D8419bAf6789593CAc, 0xcaa5d787b5ecb5a560c30a2396dd214f3c701220, 0x2bec82472a1f3ad941a94fb9d5512c9e51ec979d, 0xfa9441c7ee6289f5bfcf07d7cc29338a715ed2cb, 0x27bd6d1f438692f72cf082a62acdb45855869e29, 0x9d713e0a2f6a1c9650083ebca27f4520cd2cde8e, 0xeca5a62C3A7849cc00758b311Fd1Da98E6994C3D, 0xf7ff6c8d0264a6adf6f4ba60d427beedcbe98b50, 0x4D10962c827881B7d40d338B3f898f4B18475320, 0xDC0137542d42dD021286dD1f812eCE40EeD2873D, 0xe1ebe89ff69779a29ddb3997d6b8ed0312e5b43a													https://dtsfnwskzdpfc.cloudfront.net/logox400.jpg	https://dtsfnwskzdpfc.cloudfront.net/logo-icon.png	https://stateofthedapps.zendesk.com/attachments/token/nSC75QKyZHnIH0iUNl0qEucP9/?name=screenshot+%281%29.jpg

Moon Dust Dividends	Fuel tokens game	Join the Moon Dust Dividends game and earn Ethereum with every transaction made! With the price incremental set to  0.000000000000000001, we want to provide a stable and fun long term invest game without crazy price movements!  To enter the race to catch Moon Dust you must first buy Moon Dust Tokens with Ethereum at the Moon Dust Dividends Exchange which is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Moon Dust Token (MDT) has a price of 0.009375 ETH and the price will barely change which makes it whale proof. Whales can’t dump huge amounts of MDT so the value of your own tokens will barely change. The price increases with 0.000000000000000001 ETH which is valueless so the price will barely move, even with a one time buy or sell of 75 ETH. When you purchase MDT, you pay a 25% Moon Tax which is distributed to all other token holders. if you wish to sell your MDT you will receive 0.006825 ETH per MDT with a 9% Moon Tax which is also shared amongst all other token holders. To transfer MDT to another player, you will pay an  11% Moon Tax. When you purchase a minimum of 10 MDT, this activates your masternode which you can give to others to buy with. You will then receive an additional 20% of their 25% Moon Tax.					https://discord.gg/pXh5qEq		https://www.twitter.com/tiptopuniverse				TTT	high-risk	gambling, dividends, pyramid, metamask	GPL	Ethereum	abandoned	2018-06-02	2019-04-30	0xC137f2E6b4A42117725dD3EeE8eba4c257d579cf													https://image.ibb.co/h9Zjhd/tiptop.png

DappNode	Infrastructure for running DApps	What happens when you want to use a Decentralized P2P network, but securing your own nodes takes a lot of time and effort? You have a decentralization bottleneck at the entry point, which is where we are now in the blockchain space. At no point in the last 2 years has there been more than 13,000 Bitcoin nodes online and that number got as low as 5500 MetaMask and MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto are the primary wallets used on Ethereum and most users are using these wallets’ default nodes… This is a huge centralizing force in Ethereum. The people who do run their own node end up having to spend a lot of time troubleshooting, keeping it updated and synced without the ability to easily share their node (and efforts) with family and friends.  DAppNode will address these issues by creating a simple, easy, self-empowering system made specifically for hosting P2P clients for DApps, Cryptocurrencies, VPNs, IPFS, and more.	https://dappnode.io/	https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/wiki/DAppNode-Installation-Guide	https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode		https://riot.im/app/#/room/#DAppNode:matrix.org		https://twitter.com/dappnode				DappNode Team	development	infrastructure, development, coding, software, metamask, IPFS	GPL 3.0	Ethereum	live	2018-07-13	2018-07-13

EthPolls	Secure Poll Voting	Online poll voting and statistics suffer the vulnerabilities of voting bots, uneducated users who cast votes and a centralized third party hosting the vote.  A real world example of these issues is on many exchanges. Exchanges often hold votes in which they allow users to vote on which coins they want as a listed asset on the exchange. The coin with the most votes wins. More often then not, coin developers/project leaders pay for voting bots or dishonestly encourage the community to vote on their project. Holding votes on a blockchain allows for votes to be protected from voting bots via Ethereum's protocol (specifically gas transaction fees), this also eliminates the incentive for uneducated users to vote since each vote will cost a small amount of Ether and each voter can only vote once. EthPolls removes the third party and ensures additional security and honesty regarding votes.	https://ethpolls.com/	https://ethpollsdapp.surge.sh/	https://github.com/sliriano/EthPolls/								Sliriano	governance	metamask, voting, democracy, social, poll	GPL	Ethereum	beta	2018-09-04	2019-04-22	0x2907c2476ef38579a9e6650241da80ec1a8225ce, 0xd17C31De7eb280016001f87F5E0Efd0146fC3cc1													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/72e82%2Flogomakr-5npipq.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/2z485%2Flogomakr-8vifub.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/86crk%2Fethpollsscreenshot.png

Shape	Gaming based mining	Earn money by playing your favorite games!  With our platform we give every gamer the chance to get a proper monetary reward for their gaming skill in any supported game on our platform.  Our platform is based upon a two-token system:  Energy (ENG) is the lifeblood of the platform and can be mined on our platform using either the in-browser or offline mining functionality.  Bluedots (BD) is our Ether-backed store-of-value token.  The ratio of exchange is 1:1000 (BD/ENG) -- for one BD, you get 1000 ENG.  Ether can be exchanged for BD and vice versa at a 1:1 ratio.  In order to participate in a competition on our platform, you need to stake a certain amount of the ENG token.  Then, all you need to do is start gaming and, at the end of the competition, the total stake amount of all players will be converted into the currency BD and distributed according to their in-game performance.  So, the better you play, the more BD you will receive in return!

CryptoCongress	On-chain voting by crypto VIPs	Forging consensus in distributed and often anonymous blockchain networks is a difficult and delicate task. Nevertheless, verifying digital identities for more formalised decision-making processes may be desirable to advance the state of the art of blockchain technology and to counter organised cyber attacks. CryptoCongress contributes an Ethereum-based voting scheme with novel token distribution to reputable digital identities. No less than two-thirds of tokens are distributed to a maximum of 996 digital identities in the cryptocurrency space. The number of tokens allotted to each identity is determined by an algorithmic appraisal of credibility based on quality Twitter followers. These initial tokens are claimed by a smart contract that proves ownership of these known digital identities. In a parallel process, no more than one-third of tokens are distributed to the open market by rolling crowdsale. Transacting parties must own a minimum of tokens to propose measures and vote.	http://cryptocongress.info						https://twitter.com/_CryptoCongress				Yoshirou Sho	governance	identity, voting, governance, metamask		Ethereum	live	2018-09-12	2018-09-12	0xb509A146243bE41759F5Ea1fdF874c1897D0AA44

This means that no one will be able to modify the exchange logic or control users' funds manually during the immutable period (even the contract owner will not have the power to modify or control anything).	https://deltadex.io/				https://t.me/joinchat/JJUyPRGjhXS7iB6l9FUDJQ						DeltaDex Team	exchanges	exchange, tracking, token, coins, eos		EOS	live	2018-09-19	2018-09-19								deltadexcode						https://deltadex.io/static/media/logo.dbf2ec7d.png	https://deltadex.io/static/media/logo.dbf2ec7d.png		
PumpDumpWars	Combat multiplayer game	The game will choose the opponent according to your hero’s level. To participate in a battle, a hero must have a fully recovered life. A battle has rounds. One round lasts for one minute. During the round, all players must attack their opponents. In case somebody is not attacking, he receives damage without using his protection, without causing any damage to the opponent. The battle ends when at least one hero runs out of life. If none of the players managed to attack during one round, the fight ends in a draw.  	https://pumpdumpwars.com/	https://game.pumpdumpwars.com/			https://t.me/pumpdumpwars	https://steemit.com/@pumpdumpwars					PumpDumpWars Team	games	game, token, multiplayer, entertainment, eos		EOS	live	2018-09-19	2018-09-19								pumpdumpwars

Crypto Miner Token	Miner Token exchange 	Crypto mining token is a platform built for short term mining profit accumulation. Our service works as exchange walt for securing your mining assets in form of decentralized fully automated (CMT) token. Token is built to function without any 2nd or 3rd party control. All tokens are visible on main network and traceable for full transparency with no governance or overseeing institution involved.  Concept of this token works as follows: Crypto-miners have increasing assets via hour that most of the time is being accumulated without any actual use-case. So when you collect your mining profit of example 1.00 ETH after time it still remains as same amount of coins. Our goal is to change that. If you have accumulated assets worth 1.00 ETH and transform it into CMT you will receive matching amount of tokens to your ETH according to current market price. As token amount grows you will generate more and more ETH same as other miners whom have joined the platform. 	https://minertoken.cloud/				https://discord.gg/me6MQKb						Kompo,Piece	high-risk	gambling, metamask, ponzi, mining, rewards, metamask	MIT	Ethereum	live	2018-09-28	2018-09-30	0x0a97094c19295E320D5121d72139A150021a2702													https://i.imgur.com/krPBZpl.jpg		https://i.imgur.com/KPJIGUL.png

InkDrop	Most Rewarding Social Network.	We develop a Web 3.0 social network for communities to form freely and have meaningful, private interactions.  Problem. Today’s social networks are centrally controlled & moderated and they don't pass back the proceeds to the creators. They rely on business models that are irreconcilable with user privacy and network access is blocked in many countries.  Solution. InkDrop is an easy-to-use, truly private and censorship resistant platform for online communities. We simplify digital content monetization, incentivize fruitful user behavior and enable community self-regulation. Ultimately, the ones who advance the network as a whole are the ones that profit from it.  How? With our Web 3.0 social network, accessible via a user-friendly web app. It runs fully decentralized on the Ethereum Blockchain & IPFS. Personal data & content is encrypted and only accessible to authorized users. Using Ether cryptocurrency (ETH), we designed an effective governance protocol called Proof-of-Care.	http://inkdrop.tech		https://github.com/inkdrop-network	https://www.reddit.com/r/inkdrop		medium.com/inkdrop					Tobias Schoder,Michael Kaserer	social	community, rewards, social, network, metamask	GPL-3.0	Ethereum	beta	2018-10-10	2018-12-17														https://image.ibb.co/jx7hw9/Ink_Drop_Logo_CMYK_caption_400x95.png	https://image.ibb.co/bQTfG9/Ink_Drop_Logo_Bildmarke_CMYK_192x192.png	https://image.ibb.co/fKgjb9/Product_image_01.png

Releasing the pixels unlocks them again. Data is stored at the Ethereum Blockchain, images are automatically uploaded to IPFS.  Since all actions are recorded forever, we'll be able to replay the applications evolution from an empty canvas to a blooming and lifely advertisement, greetings and opinion platform.

King of Eth	Strategy board game	Imagine your favorite board game. Now imagine playing that board game with thousands of players for decades.  Welcome to King of Eth. Throughout the game, the players of King of Eth vie for the best spots of territory on the board in order to gain prestige in the Kingdom of Eth. In this rather primitive world, prestige is marked by the titles that each player has claimed.  In general the players of King of Eth are just plebs, constantly working towards one of the three titles in the Kingdom.  A very special pleb may earn the title of King. This pleb must claim the throne from the previous King by proving himself more worthy, and worth  is determined by the amount of land that a pleb holds. If at any time a pleb has more houses than the current King they may claim the throne and become the King themselves.  The Wayfarer is the pleb in King of Eth who holds the most roads.

TokenGen	The leading end-to-end ICO automation tool	TokenGen provides users with a very simple and straightforward way of creating and running a token crowdsale. The tool features an intuitive step-by-step process. In the first two steps, users have to select their token and fundraiser features. By default, TokenGen starts with basic smart contract templates for both the token and the fundraiser. However, there's more advanced features, which users can add in steps one and two if they find something that they need. In the third step users have to provide necessary project details such as project name, description, url, token name, fundraiser start and end dates, etc. Finally, on step four, they have to pay a fee in Fabric Tokens (FT) in order to gain access to their smart contract package. Once users make payment and the transaction is processed, they are redirected to the Projects page where they can track the progress of their project.	https://tokengen.io	https://tokengen.io	https://github.com/FabricToken	https://reddit.com/r/FabricToken/	https://t.me/fabric_token	https://fabrictoken.io/blog/	https://twitter.com/fabric_token	https://www.facebook.com/fabrictoken/			Niquid Tech	development	ico, metamask, tokens, creation	Proprietary	Ethereum	live	2018-10-15	2019-03-15	0xC94E0416b93F2A89fD966bC7DC965d096F43B69C, 0x78a73b6cbc5d183ce56e786f6e905cadec63547b													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/z47dt%2Ftokengen-lockup-light-bg.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/mer8x%2Ftokengen-logomark-light-bg-192x192.png	https://tokengen.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/TokenGen%20Product%20Image.png

The concept of CITY chain is to "redefine urban life by applying blockchain technology and game rules". As the bottom public chain of future urban life, all urban life scenes can be connected to CITY chain. Consumption scenes can be paid by endogenous Token.

Ludos Protocol	Blockchain Gaming Amplified	Ludos Protocol is a purpose-built blockchain infrastructure project for the gaming community. As only the third blockchain project to be backed by Japanese investment giant Softbank, Ludos addresses numerous shortcomings in the existing gaming landscape. Its main chain + multi-sidechain architecture allows games to run entirely on their own blockchain, preventing scalability issues that have plagued previous blockchain-based games. Additionally, the Protocol seeks to create a gamer-friendly ecosystem whereby game developers and gamers can come together to easily crowdfund and build on the platform. The use of non-fungible tokens (NFT’s) within the ecosystem will allow gamers to swap assets in one game for assets in another. Finally, through their partnership with FullPay Japan, Ludos will give gamers the chance to use LUD tokens that are earned in-game to shop and buy at a range of retail stores in Japan and later the world.	https://ludos.one/		https://github.com/Ludos-One	https://www.reddit.com/r/LudosProtocol/	https://t.me/LudosProtocol	https://medium.com/ludos-protocol	https://twitter.com/LudosProtocol	https://facebook.com/project.ludos/			Tai Jin,Joe Meng,Hoshino Joy,Kevin Zhang,Peng,Sakamoto Yui,Alex Wang,Fenny Wang,Peter Du	games	games, entertainment, chance, rewards, metamask	Proprietary	Ethereum	wip	2018-11-03	2018-11-03														https://imgur.com/zfMrqAr	https://i.imgur.com/g61oN0p.png

This particular upgrade goes green regarding energy usage, in which the Ethereum blockchain no longer uses energy-wasting ‘Proof of Work’ mining, but rather, more secure, energy saving POS.

520 G₲	A scam or a blessing in disguise?	If you are good at sales, you can register a team and affiliate some active players.   All players may get the champion by working hard: buying more keys as early as possible and playing collaboratively with your teammates.  You may try risk, preparing your script and hacking at the end of game.  Maybe you are a teammate of the winner or the champion. Maybe you lose... No matter whether you win or not, remember: what you lose on the swings you get back on the roundabouts.  如果你善于销售，你能够注册一个团队，将活跃的玩家收归旗下。  所有玩家都可通过努力获得冠军：尽早买多些钥匙，和队友协同作战。  你也可以冒险，准备好脚本，在游戏最后一刻发起攻击。  可能你会是赢家或冠军队员。可能你会输... 没关系，无论输赢，你会知道：失之东隅，收之桑榆。	https://520.GeekGit.com	https://520.GeekGit.com			https://discord.gg/rStaHth						GeekGit.com	games	teamwork, rewards, interest balance, token, game, Metamask	proprietary	Ethereum	live	2018-05-28	2018-11-24	0x9d76ea825f77bd31247fa4a4a6c42b4065b3677e	0xabef1776a0c6fbfa81c1c78a094b42c6e364542b	0xce01c9d27cef53cb43f35e283c60bb6ce6f2cd4b	0x860137473ba178588fa90351a49eefc1a6821cf6										https://520.geekgit.com/rps00.png	https://520.geekgit.com/rps01.jpg

Eholders	Tokenized smart contract high income in the medium	The EtherHolders platform is located on the blockchain Ethereum network, absolutely safe for investments, no one except you can access your ETH.

The creators are involved in the project as ordinary investors. Is this not the best proof of its reliability? The system does not provide for the daily payment of interest to the depositor, as is the case in most projects. In fact, you are not a contributor, namely an investor who purchases shares of EtherHolders - "EH".    How does it work: You at any time have the opportunity to return at least half of the contribution, the second half is distributed to all shareholders in the form of dividends in ETH, in proportion to the number of shares acquired. Plus, the system is arranged in such a way that with each purchase of a stock, its value grows, which in turn gives ad					https://t.me/EtherHolders						EtherHolders,HoldInvest	finance	finance		Ethereum	abandoned	2018-11-17	2019-07-30	0x6Cc9DB1BE24450F28b298d045CC0EcaC552F1f83

Hit 100 million	An interesting number game 	🤩🎊🎉 Surprise! 🎉🎊🤩 Relax! this is just an interesting number game based on Ethereum and the game code is Open Source. LuckyTeam believes that after playing H1M, the ETH in your wallet may increase exponentially, as long as you are lucky. Of course, we can't assure you that what we said is only possible, maybe! The only thing we can guarantee is that the game contract is open, transparent, and no one can tamper with, including LuckyTeam. 📖📖📖 Brief description 📖📖📖 The game has a sum of numbers called SON, and the initial value of SON for each round starts from zero. Each time a sniper sends an ETH, it gets a random number (between 1 and 100,000,000). These numbers are sorted and placed in the queue. Each time a random number is generated, it is added to the SON. The random number increases SON equals 100 million, and this lucky sniper will win the pot.							https://twitter.com/hit100me				Luckyteam	high-risk	metamask, trustless, open-source, gambling, pyramid	GPL	Ethereum	abandoned	2018-11-30	2019-07-30	0x3a6E5F1c1B0de5D2B46BABD21C7844c96f5180Aa													https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1066774752390537217/tIOMi3TP_400x400.jpg	https://hit100.me/H1Mfavicon.ico	https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s16ND6xwjf4Sa9rS5jlT0g.png

Devery	Track and verify your products	Devery.io is developing the Devery Protocol, a decentralized verification platform that enables marking and tracking over the Ethereum network. The protocol allows manufacturers, brands, retailers and any other party to assign unique signatures to any products, services or digital goods sold, issued and traded online. The unique signatures are stored on the Ethereum network and can be queried to determine contextual data (including location, date, manufacturer/point-of-origin and the identification of the verifying party). Verification is not limited to the sale of physical goods and services, and can be extended to verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of any digital goods and services (such as certificates and courses). The protocol is the base layer of the Devery ecosystem.

PCHAIN	Native multichain platform	The PCHAIN Network supports cross-chain calls. With the toolkit provided by the PCHAIN Network, the smart  contract  on  the  PCHAIN  Network  can  be  invoked  using  non-native  Tokens  of  other  chains.  The toolkit currently supports BCH and Tokens following the ERC20 protocol.The  principle  is  as  follows.  When  the  toolkit  provided  by  the  PCHAIN  Network,  which  is  used  on  other blockchains, invokes the smart contract of the PCHAIN Network with a certain number of Tokens in this blockchain,  the  exchange  rate  between  the  Token  and  PAI  (Token  of  the  PCHAIN  Network)  will  be acquired  by  the  toolkit  firstly  through  the  smart  data  in  Knowledge  Graph.  When  the  convertible  PAI  is enough to run the called smart contract, the toolkit will transfer the corresponding number of Tokens to the PCHAIN Network and consume the corresponding quantity of PAI of the PCHAIN Network to invoke the smart contract.	https://pchain.org/		https://github.com/pchain-org	https://www.reddit.com/user/pchain_org	https://t.me/pchain_org		https://twitter.com/pchain_org				PCHAIN	development	development, multichain, applications, network, tools	GPL 3.0	Ethereum	prototype	2018-12-21	2018-12-21	0xb9bb08ab7e9fa0a1356bd4a39ec0ca267e03b0b3

Chibera	Open World MMORPG	We welcome you to Chibera, a land that is still recovering from being torn apart and mutated by an explosion that was caused by a mana experiment centuries ago. Because of this accident, a tree was mutated into what is now called the world tree, along with the mutation of humans, elves, dwarves, and animals which lead to the rise of multiple new intelligent bipedal species.  Some races are now fully dependent on the mana for technological, economic, cultural reasons and some even need to consume it just to survive. This has caused a rift between some of the factions and a fight for control over as much of the resource as possible. The only mana sources now in the world are hard mana crystal deposits and the power that the world tree provides which is the only replenishing resource. This has lead to factions fighting for the resource for their own selfish reasons.	https://chibera.com	https://chibera.com/			https://discord.gg/xXFNbW	https://steemit.com/@chibera	https://twitter.com/chiberacom	https://www.facebook.com/chiberacom			Chibera inc	games	gaming, mmorpg, mmo, game, steem	MIT	Steem	broken	2018-12-23	2019-01-17									chibera, chiberabot					https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/wu8fm%2Fchibera5.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/j9bhd%2Fboar.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/yz3sf%2Fland8.png

Aion Scheduling System	Scheduling transactions with arbitrary bytecode	Given the structure of Ethereum, it is not possible to schedule calls to contracts at a point in the future. This is because smart contracts cannot subscribe to events and therefore all the actions need to be triggered by an entity external to the contract.

As such, it  is designed to makes decisions separate and apart from Veritaseum or other entities and it must be considered autonomous and sovereign in its actions and existence.  Communication is performed in machine language to and from the VeADIR summarizing the token purchases, distributions, valuation forensics and market liquidity.  The VeADIR will pay operating fees to Veritaseum (tokens, either USD-locked or other) for real world research.

Scorchable Payments	Scorched Earth payments, zero incentive to scam.	Scorchable payments are a simple method for making payments in Dai or ether with more safety than direct transfers for everyone. They are free and have no centralised third party controlling escrows. Neither party can benefit from dishonouring the deal so there is no incentive for scams to ever occur. The process follows three stages:  1 -> A payer creates a payment by sending Dai or ether into the contract and specifying who can receive it and what bond they should pay. During this stage the payer can cancel the payment to reclaim all of the funds unless the bond was zero.  2 -> The payee can pay the bond to remove the payers option to cancel the payment.  3 -> The payer can release any portion of the funds (payment plus bond) to the payee, or scorch them (funds sent to 0x0). The payee can also send the funds back to the payer in case they can not fulfil their end. If the payer fails to act before the timeout date, or extend the timeout date, the payee may claim the funds.	https://stobiewan.github.io/scorchable-payments/	https://stobiewan.github.io/scorchable-payments/	https://github.com/stobiewan/scorchable-payments								Mark Stobie	finance	metamask, finance, DAI	MIT	Ethereum	live	2019-01-15	2019-01-15	0xb8c27c2d49d33975e31938577a0c35ea262889e4															https://stateofthedapps.zendesk.com/attachments/token/a9RctnHcJtTIfNo16sMZbJxto/?name=SPscreenshot.jpg

HIPR	Human Initiated Performance Reporting	The current HIPR dapp is a tile slide puzzle game in which users play & submit scores to a leaderboard. This leaderboard then airdrops HERC tokens to the top players at the end of the season.  The restful-api library is for developers to build games on top of and airdrop their own tokens!  In the background a 3rd party verifcation system allows for the review and checksum of transaction hashes.  From a technology standpoint, HIPR implements steganography, an age old cryptography process to encrypt the Hercules protocol supply chain metrics into puzzles humans perform to validation of chain data integrity.  HIPR is built with Unity3D, with C# for gameplay and Solidity for smart contracts. It targets WebGL thanks to emscripten and WASM and it interacts with smart contracts with Web3 library. From market research we have found this Consensus model is 90% more efficient as we scale in HIPR players because the more we entertain our community, the more integrious our chain data becomes.	https://hipr.one	https://hipr.one/validate	https://github.com/hercone/hipr	https://www.reddit.com/r/herctoken	t.me/herc_token		https://twitter.com/hiprgames				Hercules SEZC	games	game, puzzle, airdrops, tokens, verification	APACHE 2.0 	Ethereum	live	2019-01-29	2019-04-18	0xf792c43f23c39f7de185cfdc6ce96aa69e9f00c1	0xf792c43f23c39f7de185cfdc6ce96aa69e9f00c1												https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/w7ba5%2Fhipr-logo-loop.gif	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/5uaq7%2Fhipr-logo-192x192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/y8fww%2Fphoto5845763541888511366.jpg

Gittron	Collectible Robots, Support Open Source	Gittron uses NFTs as a gamified funding mechanism to support Open Source projects. Any open source repo on Github can register at Gittron.me which generates a Prime Bot NFT (ERC721), a programmatically unique digital asset built off of the codebase (languages, commits/hr, sentimentality, etc). This Prime Bot is now an autonomous fundraiser for the open source project. Anyone in the world can go to the Prime Bot’s page on Gittron and support it for the price set by the owner. These funds go straight to the project, and the supporter gets a unique Support Bot NFT in return.	https://gittron.me	https://gittron.me	https://github.com/odyssy-automaton/od-gittron-web		https://discord.gg/kNYPCu		https://twitter.com/Gittron_				Odyssy, Ven Gist, Sam Kuhlmann, Dekan Brown	games	nft, fundraising, open-source, game, erc721, collectible	MIT	Ethereum	live	2019-03-05	2019-03-05	0x162d3e80d51f96240ae0a44ab3a5b1ea23920ce4			0xfb6ff3d0eba6b8e69fceb04afe5f230611a34a36										https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/g9jgy%2Fgittron-logo.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/7mkf5%2Fgittron-avatar-192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/m6bw4%2Fgittron-og-image-1200.jpg	
Find The Rabbit - POA	Game with true unhackable randomness	The objective of the game is to guess correctly where your opponent chose to hide the rabbit in or you could also opt to be a game host and hide the rabbit yourself.  At this moment in time, you could place bets with your #ETH or #POA tokens, and the good thing is that you have 50% chance to win no matter how many rounds you decide to play. The sole fact that picking the hat logic is entirely controlled by your choice makes this p2p game truly exciting and unpredictable.	https://findtherabbit.me	https://findtherabbit.me	https://github.com/findtherabbit	https://www.reddit.com/u/findtherabbit	https://t.me/joinchat/CPaX9EBF4PGHHPwccYDfsQ	https://findtherabbit.github.io/wiki/	https://twitter.com/findrabbitDapp				Rabbit Team	gambling	social, p2p, gambling, gamble, game	Proprietary	POA	live	2019-03-06	2019-03-06					0x152d57780ff1da6fa08e2c4bc4c739ea6f001e8c									https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/2hjqb%2Ftw-2-400x200.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/6baav%2Fandroid-chrome-192x192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/4k5ry%2Ffind-the-rabbit-2019-02-27-14-36-59.jpg

bulktokensending	Send as many token transfers as you wish	The first problem: Previously in Ethereum Network, additional tools were required in order to transfer many ERC20 tokens at once. Many people still do this manually, one transaction at a time. This process is time consuming and prone to an error.  The first solution: This Dapp allows a user to send thousands of token transfers in a very efficient way by batching them in groups of 145 token transfers per Ethereum transaction. This automation saves time by automatically generating transactions to MetaMask. Finally, this tool allows a user to maintain security of their account by delegating the trust of their private keys to a secure MetaMask wallet. Send Ethereum tokens in the bulk operation mode.

EthexBet	Guess the symbols of the real ETH block hash!	Ethex is a very simple game and it differs from others:  1. We don’t use any random generator - you guess the symbols of a real, upcoming Ethereum hash block. It makes Ethex as fair and cheat-free as possible.  2. No sign ups and deposits.   3. It is about fun to play Ethex Lottery! We have five different jackpots: - Time-based - daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally  - And one chance-based Superprize!  Making a bet, you automatically take part in at least four jackpots. So if you buy, for example, one ticket with at least two symbols, you will have a reason to return for the next three months (until the end of the season).   Isn’t that cool? 🙂	https://ethex.bet	https://ethex.bet	https://github.com/ethex-bet/ethex-contracts		https://t.me/EthexBet	 https://medium.com/ethexbet	https://twitter.com/Ethex_bet	https://www.facebook.com/Ethex-403768580384751/			Ethex Team	gambling	lottery, gambling, fair, chance, rewards	MIT	Ethereum	live	2019-03-14	2019-08-19	0xe06d27b95616cd9922a4af2ee95f6802b7e08a9a, 0x331769de477c2122638fe1116808d3a9159ab13a, 0xe04E049bAef6977f8B9d9Eb6215641a19dB5B310,  0xb9846a7d15d188263f99f2da6d1fdab2febdb0a2													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/zpm63%2F.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/yx4zt%2Fr.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/p56mj%2Fethex-2.jpg

As users mine the FUTB smart contract with these ERC tokens, they earn FUTB tokens which can later be used re-exchnage for a much greater share of the tokens. This is an exciting and extremely profitable token game with real Bitcoin price history and mining block size price dynamics built over 5 separate and integrated smart contracts into one Master Contract. 	https://futereum.com				https://discordapp.com/invite/JWv9eQp		@futereum1	https://www.facebook.com/futereum1			Somsak D.

Orbiter 8	Explore, trade, and battle across the galaxy!  	It is the year 2140, just a little more than a century after humans began off-world colonization, and civilization has spread to encompass the whole of the solar system.  In just the last few decades, we’ve seen rapid improvements in Obiter technology, drastically reducing travel times between planets. This technology recently crossed a whole new threshold with the successful interstellar test of the Orbiter 8 spacecraft. We are no longer confined to our solar system, the whole of the galaxy now awaits our arrival. The first line of interstellar Orbiters are being assembled right now and will be on sale soon.

Dai Card	Transact instantly, cheaply, and securely in Dai	The Dai Card application, a simple browser-hosted wallet, allows users to transact instantly, cheaply, and securely in Dai.   Similar to a physical debit card, users “top up” their Dai Card balance by depositing Eth (or Dai) directly to their Dai Card address, which gets instantly swapped into Dai and represented as USD in-channel. Users can withdraw their funds directly into Eth without needing to pay gas, dramatically simplifying the “cash out” experience.   Because the Dai Card runs on the Ethereum mainnet in payment channels, user funds are always self-custodied and can be exited regardless of the hub’s availability.

Token ² Curated Registry	Curated list of tokens and their badges	The Token² Curated Registry is a curated list of tokens.  It allows users to submit tokens, their symbols, their addresses and their tickers. To avoid malicious tokens, submitters need to put a deposit. Challengers can challenge submissions by also putting a deposit. When they do, a dispute is created and sent to Kleros. If they win their dispute, they get the deposit of the submitter. This incentivizes people to watch for malicious submissions.  Users can also add badges to tokens certifying that the token meets certain characteristics. This follows the same deposit/challenge scheme.	https://tokens.kleros.io/	https://tokens.kleros.io/	https://github.com/kleros/tokens-on-trial				@klerosT2CR				Matheus Faria de Alencar,Plinio Braga,Clément Lesaege,William George	governance	token, curation	MIT	Ethereum	live	2019-03-24	2019-05-27	0xebcf3bca271b26ae4b162ba560e243055af0e679,0x916deab80dfbc7030277047cd18b233b3ce5b4ab, 0xCb4Aae35333193232421E86Cd2E9b6C91f3B125F													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/pswyr%2Ft2cr-logo-400w-trans.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/rjskj%2Ft2cr-icon-192x192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/6zkbq%2Fkleros-1200x630-t2cr.jpg

Eclipse	Automatic CPU & NET delegation to dApps and users	Eclipse is an automatic resource management tool that helps teams scale EOS dApps without worrying about resources. We work for Dapps by:  1) Analyzing all transactions on the blockchain to identify dApp accounts and associated active user accounts.  2) Providing CPU, NET & RAM to designated accounts before they run out of resources. No extra step required from a user or a Dapp.  As a result, dApp teams experience:  - Consistent Resource Availability. No more worrying about sudden resource price fluctuations.  - 90% Less Time on Resource Management. Signing up takes less than 5 minutes, and requires no code integration. No need to make one developer focus on resource management at all times.  - Pay-By-Usage for Just Enough. Never pay for unused resources.  - Keep Your Users Online, Hassle Free. Don’t lose another user due to staking complexity again.  We have designed our tool while working with some of the top dApp teams and stakeholders in EOS. 	https://eclipse.one/	https://eclipse.one/			https://t.me/joinchat/IcfGJhZ3v7j5RqaUuIPg6w		@dunyalabs				Dunya Labs	development	games, tool, infrastructure, developers, development		EOS	beta	2019-03-29	2019-03-29														https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/nr6he%2Fslide1.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/b8sdm%2Feclipsesquare.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/cek2k%2Fcapture.jpg

Multiprizer	Multiply your prize winnings by strategic gameplay	Multiprizer is a strategy based game in which a player can choose from multiple gameboards of different game-play. The player purchases one or more tokens. Once the round timer is elapsed, a player is chosen using the most powerful random number in blockchain history - Ledger based random of Oraclize, with on-chain proof verification. The winner gets all the tokens of that game round, after edge.  This game depends more on strategy than 'Provable Random Number' as one can revert their tokens after purchase also, till any time before timer expires. Some game boards have as low as 40 tokens to purchase in total, which gives a very high probability to win - (1/40) per token purchased.  There is even an option of 'DirectPlay' which doesnt even require visiting the site. One can send a specific amount of tokens to the contract address and the player participation is auto-confirmed to a specific game-board depending on token amount. This makes the game fully decentralized & tamper-proof.	https://multiprizer.io/	https://ethereum.multiprizer.io	https://github.com/kombos/mp-ethereum				@multiprizer				Kamlesh P	games	metamask, game, strategy, prize, timer	Apache 2.0	Ethereum	live	2019-04-19	2019-05-15	0x4E0C7a80dBf4aCdD6F020c3dD796Ef5b97D26Ed0, 0x8E19A78146c50810da3FA93C3Adf237f8de70306	0x44cd9Cf21c589ac9D92a18782771485aF02250F9, 0xCb061C64c6Cfa3DC923a6a620A6E7BEFf0A0D16d												https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/m7mb3%2Fmultiprizer-01.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/8s7yc%2Fmultiprizerlogoart2.png	https://stateofthedapps.zendesk.com/attachments/token/nEXo37LTauuwGxmpVNrjGTv2Z/?name=Banner.png

VoteChain	Voting dApp - Smart Contract	The motivation for proposing this decentralized application (dApp) raises from the new system of referendums that the Mexican Government implemented, which can be improved by including a hybrid of blockchain digital and physical voting. The past July of 2018, Mexico had general elections for president, and has underwent three referendums that have had immediate impact in the future of the Mexican people and the countries' economy. The Instituto Nacional Electoral INE (https://www.ine.mx/credencial/estadisticas-lista-nominal-padron-electoral/) , is the institution responsible of preparation, execution and definition of the electoral processes. However, given the nature of "Public Consultation" the INE acts as a mere advisor to the civil organization that is in charge of the complete logistics through México Decide (https://mexicodecide.com.mx/) . Socially empowered movements like the latter, the use of blockchain technology in addition to the infrastructure provided by Government institutions like INE could strengthen the democratic processes in Mexico.			https://github.com/danybonfil/DanielBonfil_FinalProject_BlockChain								Daniel Bonfil	governance	voting, governance, social		Ethereum	prototype	2019-04-22	2019-04-22

alias.earth	Open source identity platform	alias.earth allows users to create an alias on the blockchain thats managed by their Ethereum address.  We are building tools and enlisting developers to help reclaim the Internet. Your digital identity—the unique online presence that is “you”—is increasingly managed and monetized by a small group of massive corporations. (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Etc...). As the Internet has expanded to take on greater social and economic significance, so has the problem of fake accounts, social media manipulation, censorship, and the aggressive monetization of personal data. Each person's virtual presence and everything they create is treated like a product to be bought and sold according to the cold money-making logic of this centralized paradigm. We have to do something to change up the structure, and the first step is taking back the identity infrastructure of the Internet so that users are not tied to any platform. 	https://alias.earth	https://alias.earth	https://github.com/lovvtide/alias-earth-core		https://discord.gg/UDbqesA						Stuart Bowman	identity	metamask, identity, data, open-source, alias	GNU	Ethereum	beta	2019-05-05	2019-05-05	0x8F6A7781F54335D10d02bDD9ce66ACE1647AbCA7													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/7jpsu%2Fstateofdapps-01.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/8263d%2Fearth-01.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/8mth7%2Fdappradarscreenshot2.jpg

Spinwin	Autonomous evolving casino, no house	Spinwin is a completely autonomous game of chance on the Ethereum blockchain that evolves and progresses over time as game conditions and its bankroll changes.  Spinwin does not have a "house" that takes profits.  Instead, players earn SPIN tokens on bet losses which allow them to reclaim ETH wagered as game conditions change.  Our goal with Spinwin was to build a blockchain based game that requires no manual intervention, maintenance or interaction from a 3rd party in order to operate.  It does not rely on Oracles or 3rd party APIs. It can be played entirely on the blockchain.  So it can theoretically outlive us, and we hope our grand kids are able to play it.   It features two games of chance, a dice-like game and a lottery, along with a referral system.  All components of Spinwin rely on completely decentralized architecture, and all game logic and workings are housed entirely on smart contracts, including the referral system.

Healthereum	Loyalty rewards platform for patients	Creating the best patient engagement platform is an ongoing struggle in healthcare. Numerous software platforms exist but patient experience is not improving and healthcare providers continue to experience frustrations in care delivery.

Sablier	Earn your salary by the minute	Sablier is a decentralised app for continuous salaries on Ethereum. We enable employees to get paid by the minute using stablecoins such as DAI or USDC.  Example: let’s imagine Alice, an employer, and Bob, an employee. Alice pays Bob $100 a day, inclusive of weekends.  1. Alice deposits $3,000 on Sablier.  2. Bob works for 5 days.  3. Bob has the right but not the obligation to withdraw up to $500 from the stream (100 x 5 days).  4. Alice has the right but not the obligation to cancel the stream and withdraw the leftover sum in her wallet, that is, $2,500. If she does this, Bob receives $500 in his wallet.  5. If 25 additional days pass and Alice doesn’t cancel the stream, Bob would be able to redeem his salary in full, that is, $3,000.	https://sablier.app	https://beta.sablier.app/	https://github.com/SablierApp	/r/sablier	https://t.me/sablier	https://medium.com/sablier-app	https://twitter.com/SablierApp	https://www.facebook.com/SablierApp			Paul Berg	finance	finance, stablecoin, payments, dai, metamask	LGPL 3.0	Ethereum	beta	2019-06-01	2019-07-01	0xeef1392e7044993Fd28bf7878DF85A365b540b92	0x623d172baE8571beFb0B133b8a1BE73894F6BE38	0x623d172baE8571beFb0B133b8a1BE73894F6BE38	0x623d172baE8571beFb0B133b8a1BE73894F6BE38										https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/jywjq%2Flogotwemoji.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/ze3en%2Flogotwemoji192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/y9ncr%2Fscreenshot3.png	
CryptoSkulls	Collectible ERC-721 Tokens	CryptoSkulls are 10,000 collectible ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens stored on Ethereum blockchain. Each CryptoSkull character is unique pixel art image.  Each CryptoSkull has its UNIQUENESS INDEX that shows total rareness of all image features. For example, CryptoSkulls with beards are rarer than without beards and have less UNIQUENESS INDEX. Each CryptoSkull (except 10 SKULL LORDS that are not generated but hand drawn) has its X-gene value saved at the moment of CryptoSkull generation. X-gene is a set of CryptoSkull feature indexes. UNIQUENESS INDEX is calculated by X-gene analysis. Possible UNIQUENESS INDEX values are 1 (SKULL LORDS), 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 22, 25, 26.	https://cryptoskulls.com		https://github.com/alexsslayer/crypto-skull		https://discord.gg/bzbMMnk		https://twitter.com/Crypto_Skulls				Alexey Kazarinov	media	art, collectible, erc721, metamask		Ethereum	live	2019-06-01	2019-07-29	0xc1Caf0C19A8AC28c41Fe59bA6c754e4b9bd54dE9													https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/mwcm8%2Flogo.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/cuzvy%2Flogo-192.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/2qf5g%2Fcryptoskulls-banner-1.png

ActnEarn	Monetize your social media influence with ActnEarn	ActnEarn helps aggregates different set of resources from many people for a common cause/action. The contributors are rewraded if an action is taken. Therefore, we call it proof of action (POA).  We observe that adoption of crypto dapps and projects is still very low as one can check at State of the Dapps. Except few dapps almost all dapps have less than 1000 users. However good may be the technology and concept but without users using them -the value will not be realized. And adoption will come from when these projects are visible but users are on conventional social media platforms.  Therefore, our immediate objective is to build a network of micro-influencers, who are active on conventional social media platforms like twitter, facebook, youtube etc. These influencers will be incentivised by our actnearn tokens to use their influence and promote crypto projects to their network. For doing that they will earn actnearn rewards. And dapp owners will buy their influence by rewarding them.	https://www.actnearn.com/	https://www.actnearn.com/			https://discordapp.com/invite/bnxQNc		@actnearn 	https://www.facebook.com/ActandEarn/?modal=admin_todo_tour			ActnEarn Team	social	social, community, network	proprietary	Steem	live	2019-06-05	2019-06-05									actnearn					https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/62fdu%2Factnearn.png	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/mjcmq%2Factnearn-resize.jpg	https://sotd-img-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/pr5ej%2Fscreenshot.png
